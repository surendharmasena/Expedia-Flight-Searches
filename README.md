# Expedia-Flight-Searches
A detailed Python analysis of more than 80 million Expedia flight searches. Extensive data cleaning, including ISO 8601 dates and durations. During the analysis, Pandas, Numpy, SciKit-Learn, Pydotplus, Seaborn, Random, and Datetime were incorporated.
For the project, three major findings were included in the Jupyter Notebook. Finding 1 utilizes linear regression and decision tree analysis to predict the total price of a one-way trip. Finding 2 discovers and displays hidden airline fees. Finding 3 examines the average flight price for each day of the week and time of day.
